  abstract={High dimensional structured data enriched model describes groups of observations by shared and per-group individual parameters, each with its own structure such as sparsity or group sparsity. In this paper, we consider the general form of data enrichment where data comes in a fixed but arbitrary number of groups G.  Any convex function, e.g., norms, can characterize the structure of both shared and individual parameters. We propose an estimator for high dimensional data enriched model and provide conditions under which it consistently estimates both shared and individual parameters. We also delineate sample complexity of the estimator and present high probability non-asymptotic bound on estimation error of all parameters. Interestingly the sample complexity of our estimator translates to conditions on both per-group sample sizes and the total number of samples. We propose an iterative estimation algorithm with linear convergence rate and supplement our theoretical analysis with synthetic and real experimental results. Particularly, we show the predictive power of data enriched model along with its interpretable results in anticancer drug sensitivity analysis.

  title={Thirty Biologically Interpretable Clusters of Transcription Factors Distinguish Cancer Type},
  author={ Abrams, Zachary B and Zucker, Mark and Wang Min and Asiaee, Amir and Abruzzo, Lynne V and Coombes, Kevin R},
  journal={ Manuscript submitted for publication},
  abstract={Background: Transcription factors are important regulators of gene expression and play critical roles in development, diﬀerentiation, and in many cancers. To carry out their regulatory programs, they must cooperate in networks and bind simultaneously to sites in promoter or enhancer regions of genes. We hypothesize that the mRNA co-expression patterns of transcription factors can be used both to learn how they cooperate in networks and to distinguish between cancer types.
Results: We recently developed a new algorithm, Thresher, that combines principal component analysis, outlier ﬁltering, and von Mises-Fisher mixture models to cluster genes (in this case, transcription factors) based on expression, determining the optimal number of clusters in the process. We applied Thresher to the RNA-Seq expression data of 486 transcription factors from more than 10,000 samples of 33 kinds of cancer studied in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that 30 clusters of transcription factors from a 29-dimensional principal component space were able to distinguish between most cancer types, and could separate tumor samples from normal controls. Moreover, each cluster of transcription factors could be either (i) linked to a tissue-speciﬁc expression pattern or (ii) associated with a fundamental biological process such as cell cycle, angiogenesis, apoptosis, or cytoskeleton. Clusters of the second type were more likely to also be associated with embryonically lethal mouse phenotypes.
Conclusions: Using our approach, we have shown that the mRNA expression patterns of transcription factors contain most of the information needed to distinguish diﬀerent cancer types. The Thresher method is capable of discovering biologically interpretable clusters of genes. It can potentially be applied to other gene sets, such as signaling pathways, to decompose them into simpler, yet biologically meaningful, components.},
